<h2 style="color:#A1A1FF;">Ethical issues relating to AI, and my personal reflections and recommendations: </h2> <br><br>



<div style="margin-right: 100px;">
	<p style="color:white">AI is a great technology, that has helped humanity progress the most it has in such a short time span.
	</p><br><br>
 
	<p style="color:white">Alongside its’ great opportunity, it also has great risk of misuse. It is predicted the next war would not be fought over land, air, and sea, but cyber warfare. Already we have cases of this with countries interfering and accessing information about civilians, elections, and country secrets. Technology in general has the ability to do a lot great, but also the same ability to do much harm.
	</p><br><br> 

	<p style="color:white">A main ethical issue of AI is that it is seen as a competitor with the fellow working man, who fears automation of many fields will case redundancy in numerous workforces. We have to find a balance between implementation and collaboration with AI. It is obvious AI is superior, but humans still need a job, finding that balance will be one we will need to find a solution to in the near future. 
	</p><br><br> 

	<p style="color:white">AI also as the ethical issue of AI bias. For instance, the Amazon recruiting AI was hiring more males than females. This issue must be watched and changed fast, as we in live in an always advancing society, we must ensure developers of AI keep AI bias in check and grow with the times too.
	</p><br><br> 

	<p style="color:white";>Overall, in my personal reflections, with any new technology, AI has a long journey ahead of it before it is perfect, but AI has helped more than it has damaged. The continuance of development is extremely important to ensure we can reach its’ full potential.
