<h1 style="color:white;">The Opportunities of AI</h1>


<h4><p style="color:white;">AI (Artificial intelligence) is the most relevant and important now than it has ever been. 
With the introduction of AI, we find the technology doing tasks for us such as:<br><br>
-        Manufacturing robots<br><br>

-        Self-driving cars<br><br>

-        Smart assistants<br><br></p>

<p style="color:white;">Without AI we would not be able to automate tasks, it allows us to make a machine do what we would consider as tedious or too complex/time consuming. 
An example of a time-consuming task is support tickets: <i style="color:Grey;" >“teams spend a good majority of their days working through cluttered support queues full of repetitive tickets. 
Employing an AI-powered support partner to help answer these questions removes the pain of searching through out-dated and hard to read knowledge articles, 
empowers employees to self-serve and opens up the IT team to work with the employees who need them the most.”</i> (Savio, 2019) Examples of where these support AI 
are implemented are in the organizations and companies such as:<br><br>

-        Vodaphone (Tobi)<br><br>

-        Uber / Uber Eats<br><br>

-        Optus<br><br>

-        Blizzard<br><br></p>

<p style="color:white;">Going on, manufacturing robots is another example of how important and relevant AI is in today’s environment. 
<i style="color:Grey;" >“The introduction of collaborative robots (or cobots) is becoming increasingly common, in industry as well as in laboratory work and commerce.” </i>(Kelnar, 2019) 
Cobots take instructions from humans in order to perform the task, but with more productivity because cobots do not have the basic necessities as a human in the same 
position has (food, water, rest, etc).
More benefits of automated manufacturing include:<br><br>

-        Direct Automation<br><br>

-        24/7 Production<br><br>

-        Workplace health and safety improvements<br><br>

-        Lower operational cost to the business<br><br>

-        Efficiently<br><br>

-        Quality Control<br><br></p>

<p style="color:white;">One of the main benefits are <i style="color:Grey;" >“the capability of Artificial Intelligence is far beyond human capacity when it comes to such 
things as miniaturisation and precision measurements, and they deliver vastly superior quality assurance.” </i> (King, 2020).
Concluding AI in manufacturing, displaying how clear of an example that AI is extremely relevant and important in today’s climate.
Following, self-driving cars are a massive innovation powered by AI and machine learning. Self-driving cars are becoming more and 
more implemented, and with that relevant. Self-driving cars use AI to make decisions about driving where humans originally would. 
They steer, adjust speed, and calculate how to avoid upcoming crashes in extreme speeds, overall reducing the crash toll worldwide. 
 In United states of America, collected data states from the <i style="color:Grey;" >“identifies driver behaviour or error as a factor in 94 percent of crashes,
 and self-driving vehicles can help reduce driver error.” </i> (Coalition for Future Mobility, 2021)
More example of the benefits of self-driving cars include:<br><br>

-  Road Safety<br><br>

-  Greater independence to immobile persons who could not travel alone before.<br><br>

- Saving Costs (Insurance costs due to lower chances of crashes, medical bills from crashes, lost of work time from crash recoveries, vehicle repairs)<br><br>

- Reduced Congestion<br><br></p>

<p style="color:white;">AI in self-driving cars is just an example but displaying how it will be massively incorporated into society, and already showing 
how promising the technology is, will end up replacing how we drive motorized vehicles forever, being extremely important to the way we will live life.
Continuing, smart assistants, they are in our mobile phones, and everyone has a mobile phone. What are smart assistants? They are automated, virtual 
supporters. They are <i style="color:Grey;" >“Intelligent virtual assistants, or intelligent personal assistants as they’re sometimes known, are AI-driven programs that can 
understand natural language and complete tasks based on your spoken commands. Whether it is to search for information, set reminders, schedule events 
or order a pizza, we are relying more and more on these technologies to organise our lives.” </i> (Digital Humans, 2020)
Examples of some voice assistants:
<br>
<br>

-        Siri (Apple)<br><br>

-        Google Assistant (Google)<br><br>

-        Alexa (Amazon)<br><br>

-        Cortana (Microsoft)<br><br></p>

<p style="color:white;">Smart Assistants have many benefits. They allow the user to have convenience of information being found for them easily, 
do tasks on their device for them, and help with the quality of life. Data shows that:
<blockquote style="color:white;" cite="https://digitalhumans.com/blog/what-are-virtual-assistants/">
-        92% of users rely on a virtual assistant to search for information. <br>
-        75% use them to set reminders.<br>
-        73% send text messages through them.<br>
-        69% book a calendar event (like a meeting or appointment) <br>
-        61% take memos through their voice-enabled friends. <br>
-        61% send emails through them. <br>
-        57% buy products or services in their workdays. <br>
</blockquote>

(This data was collected from: (Digital Humans, 2020))</p>
<br>
<p style="color:white;">More benefits include:
Increased accessibility for users who struggle to use technology features. 
Automation of tasks
Increased ease of access to features </p>
<br>
<p style="color:white;">Summarizing, smart assistants are a great quality of life improvement, and clearly displays how relevant and important AI is.
Concluding, AI (Artificial intelligence) is extremely relevant and important to the way of life we have in the world today. 
Overall, AI enhances the speed, effectiveness, and precision, this was explored and described in the three examples of 
manufacturing robots, self-driving cars, and smart assistants. Confirming AI has a solid position in society and a claim to 
being relevant and important, and with that great opportunity to use the technology.</p>
